## Overview

***Padlock*** is a game concept I thought of when I was in high school. At the time, I was very inexperienced with good software design. However, I was somewhat experienced with the Unity game engine, and I figured this project would be easy enough to complete over a weekend. I did finish the project in a weekend, but, not knowing good software design, the code ended up being incredibly messy and clearly rushed. Looking back on it now, I am astonished I could deal with that...

What I was most proud of with this project, at the time, was implementing a fill algorithm I found. Again, it was messy, but at the time I was very impressed with myself, and had a lot of fun learning how it worked. Overall, while this project does not really demonstrate my skills, it is still a neat product of my enthusiasm for games and programming.
